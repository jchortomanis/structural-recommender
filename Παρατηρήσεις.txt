1. Pop-up recommendations, when the reader comes to the end of the articles
2. Side bar with number of items proportional to text length. Eg here:
https://www.geoengineer.org/education/web-class-projects/cee-549-geoenvironmental-engineering-fall-2015/assignments/uranium-mill-tailings-remediation-in-the-united-states
we have a very long list of recommended items
3. Divide "Trending" to "Latest" and "Most Popular"
4. Website internal search engine needs to be optimized
5. Comments pointer (like Euronews.com) to drive you immediately to the comment section
6. More intensive search for content in order to add it to our website
7. Get ideas from other sites (not reinvent the wheel)
8. Fill with at least one image any article that has not one
9. On the right sidebar, the items are not distinguished easily
10. It is not easy to tell at which item the image belongs
11. Merge the recommendations from all nlp models into one list
12. Merge the output of 2-3 (or more) different "popularity" queries
12. Drop-down menu at News, Events, Education, Software (like at Publications), containing all the categories and subcategories/tags
13. We should be able to select the name/image of an author and see his profile or other articles written by him, eg "Other posts by Charles Krolikowski:"
https://www.geoengineer.org/education/web-class-projects/cee-549-geoenvironmental-engineering-fall-2015/assignments/uranium-mill-tailings-remediation-in-the-united-states
14. As the number of the items is growing, we'll recommend more similar items
15. Eg at: https://www.geoengineer.org/education/web-class-projects/ce-179-geosystems-engineering-design/assignments/st-francis-dam-worst-civil-engineering-failure-of-the-20th-century#
Some tags do not lead anywhere
16. Maybe addition of "Videos" category along with "Gallery"? Or combine them into a "Media" category?
17. Incorporation of a time decay function in the recommended items.
18. Take into account of the time the users spend on each page
19. How to compare hit rate before and after launch of the recommendation system
20. If someone is at an education/events/news item, we'll recommend to him mostly the most popular education/events/news items respectively (at the right sidebar)
21. "Recommended for you:", additional tag-based list with recommendations for users (who, unlike visitors, have declared an area of interest)
22. Additional "Users who viewed this item also viewed:" list (to our "items related to this item:" existing list)
23. Ask users to rate our recommendations (explicit feedback)
24. Ask users to rate the articles they read
25. At the Web class projects, the right sidebar differs from the other education items and no bottom bar containing similar recommendations exists
26. Insert the information of how much time needed to read the article
27. After the title, we could add a clear, specific benefit of reading the article
