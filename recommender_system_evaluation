Evaluation of the recommender system:

1. (General) hit rate: (# recommendation selections) / (# pageviews of the education, events, news categories)

2. True Positive (TP) - Item recommended and consumed by the user.
For each 'to_id', TP = number of times 'to_id' was selected by users while it was recommended.

3. False Positive (FP) - Item was recommended but the user didn’t consume it.
FP = number of times 'to_id' was not selected by users while it was recommended.

4. False Negative (FN) - The recommender didn’t include the item in a recommendation and the user consumed it.
For each 'to_id', FN = # times the 'to_id' was selected at a next session step without been recommended.

5. True Negative (TN)—It wasn’t recommended and the user didn’t consume it.


Precision - What fraction of the recommended items the user consumed.
Precision = True Positive / True Positive + False Positive.
Precision = (number of times selected) / (number of times recommended), for each 'from_id' --> 'to_id' tuple (and for each 'to_id' only, if we add the numbers up for this 'to_id').
So, we 'll need for each 'from_id' --> 'to_id' couple, daily count of # times 'to_id' was recommended and # of times 'to_id' was selected.

for each 'from_id' --> 'to_id' tuple (and for each 'to_id' only, if we add the numbers up for this 'to_id').
